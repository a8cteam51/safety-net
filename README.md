# Safety Net Lite

**for Team51 Development Sites**

## What's this?
This is a **Lite** version of Safety Net. It's basically the same, but with these changes:
- Doesn't include the user data deletion functions

Note that options still get scrubbed, however if you need to restore any specific options, they are saved as `OPTIONNAME_backup` before being scrubbed.
